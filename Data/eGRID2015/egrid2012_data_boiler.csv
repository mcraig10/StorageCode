eGRID2012 Boiler File,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This boiler file has 5 comma544 records and 35 data elements.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note that summing the boiler unadjusted emissions to the plant level may not result in the same values as the plant unadjusted emissions since additional emissions from prime movers not covered by the EPA/CAMD or EIA-923 boiler level data may be included in the plant emissions values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

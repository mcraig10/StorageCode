TO RUN A RUN:
1) 'module load anaconda', then 'source activate py34'
2) copy over folder w/ CEtoUC folder
3) edit storageJobQueue with desired parameters
4) sbatch storageJobQueue.pbs
To check job status: squeue -u username
To cancel job: scancel jobid

TO MODIFY SCRIPT FOR USE ON CLUSTER:
1) make setKeyParameters and masterFuntion take in parameters
2) Comment out corresponding parameters in setKeyParametesr
3) Comment out masterFunction() call
4) set xsedeRun to True and remote to True


WHEN START NEW SERVER SESSION, TYPE:
module load anaconda
source activate py34
[Check by typing: python. SHould start py3.4 session in anaconda]


STEPS TAKEN TO GET PYTHON AND GAMS SET UP
All in home directory:
1) Install GAMS - use Unix distribution
2) Run .exe, follow installation steps
2b) Changed path variable to include folder where gams.exe is, so can simply call "gams"
3) Load anaconda module: module load anaconda
4) Create 3.4 Python env: conda create -n py34 python=3.4 anaconda]
5) Activate env: source activate py34
6) Test GAMS & Python installs: which gams        which python
	Can also call python and see what it loads
7) Setup GAMS-Python API link by navigating to GAMS/24.7/apifiles/python/api_34 and typing: python setup.py install


DEBUGGING
When ran GAMS, got error as follows:
	gams.workspace.GamsException: Could not load shared library /home/mtcraig/gams/gams24.8_linux_x64_64_sfx/libgmdcclib64.so: /home/mtcraig/.conda/envs/py34/lib/python3.4/site-packages/matplotlib/../../../libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found (required by /home/mtcraig/gams/ga
	To fix this problem, ran 'conda update libgcc'
	Also in trying (but failing) to fix this problem, I modified the LD_Library_Path var by adding 2 dirs: /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib64


MISC INFO
Each core used in job has about 4 GB RAM
Seems best to use RM-shared
mkl on python installs indicates  multi-threaded from intel
To not open new window w/ emacs, type : emacs __ -ns
Move to pylon2 with: cd /pylon2    [then back to home with /home/mtcraig]
To get info on Qs: squeue -u mtcraig
export instead of set for setting environment variable
$WDIR: points to WDIR directory
${WDIR}: use when appending to WDIR name, e.g. if WDIR is Result and watn to store in Result1
